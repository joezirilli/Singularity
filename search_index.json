Combined with Apache Mesos, it provides efficient management of the underlying processes life cycle and effective use of cluster resources.\n\nSingularity is an essential part of the HubSpot Platform and is ideal for deploying micro-services. It is optimized to manage thousands of concurrently running processes in hundreds of servers.\nHow it Works\nSingularity is an Apache Mesos framework. It runs as a task scheduler on top of Mesos Clusters taking advantage of Apache Mesos' scalability, fault-tolerance, and resource isolation. Apache Mesos is a cluster manager that simplifies the complexity of running different types of applications on a shared pool of servers. In Mesos terminology, Mesos applications that use the Mesos APIs to schedule tasks in a cluster are called frameworks.\n\nThere are different types of frameworks and most frameworks concentrate on a specific type of task (e.g. long-running vs scheduled cron-type jobs) or supporting a specific domain and relevant technology (e.g. data processing with hadoop jobs vs data processing with spark). \nSingularity tries to be more generic by combining long-running tasks and job scheduling functionality in one framework to support many of the common process types that developers need to deploy every day to build modern web applications and services. While Mesos allows multiple frameworks to run in parallel, it greatly simplifies the PaaS architecture by having a consistent and uniform set of abstractions and APIs for handling deployments across the organization. Additionally, it reduces the amount of framework boilerplate that must be supported - as all Mesos frameworks must keep state, handle failures, and properly interact with the Mesos APIs. These are the main reasons HubSpot engineers initiated the development of a new framework. As of this moment, Singularity supports the following process types:\n\nWeb Services. These are long running processes which expose an API and may run with multiple load balanced instances. Singularity supports automatic configurable health checking of the instances at the process and API endpoint level as well as load balancing. Singularity will automatically restart these tasks when they fail or exit. \nWorkers. These are long running processes, similar to web services, but do not expose an API. Queue consumers are a common type of worker processes. Singularity does automatic health checking, cool-down and restart of worker instances.\nScheduled (CRON-type) Jobs. These are tasks that periodically run according to a provided CRON schedule. Scheduled jobs will not be restarted when they fail unless instructed to do so. Singularity will run them again on the next scheduling cycle.\nOn-Demand Processes. These are manually run processes that will be deployed and ready to run but Singularity will not automatically run them. Users can start them through an API call or using the Singularity Web UI, which allows them to pass command line parameters on-demand.\n\nSingularity Components\nMesos frameworks have two major components. A scheduler component that registers with the Mesos master to be offered resources and an executor component that is launched on cluster slave nodes by the Mesos slave process to run the framework tasks. \nThe Mesos master determines how many resources are offered to each framework and the framework scheduler selects which of the offered resources to use to run the required tasks. Mesos slaves do not directly run the tasks but delegate the running to the appropriate executor that has knowledge about the nature of the allocated task and the special handling that might be required.\n\nAs depicted in the figure, Singularity implements the two basic framework components as well as a few more to solve common complex / tedious problems such as task cleanup and log tailing / archiving without requiring developers to implement it for each task they want to run:\nSingularity Scheduler\nThe scheduler is the core of Singularity: a DropWizard API that implements the Mesos Scheduler Driver. The scheduler matches client deploy requests to Mesos resource offers and acts as a web service offering a JSON REST API for accepting deploy requests.\nClients use the Singularity API to register the type of deployable item that they want to run (web service, worker, cron job) and the corresponding runtime settings (cron schedule, # of instances, whether instances are load balanced, rack awareness, etc.). \nAfter a deployable item (a request, in API terms) has been registered, clients can post Deploy requests for that item. Deploy requests contain information about the command to run, the executor to use, executor specific data, required cpu, memory and port resources, health check URLs and a variety of other runtime configuration options. The Singularity scheduler will then attempt to match Mesos offers (which in turn include resources as well as rack information and what else is running on slave hosts) with its list of Deploy requests that have yet to be fulfilled.\n\nRollback of failed deploys, health checking and load balancing are also part of the advanced functionality the Singularity Scheduler offers. A new deploy for a long runing service will run as shown in the diagram below.\n\nWhen a service or worker instance fails in a new deploy, the Singularity scheduler will rollback all instances to the version running before the deploy, keeping the deploys always consistent. After the scheduler makes sure that a Mesos task (corresponding to a service instance) has entered the TASK_RUNNING state it will use the provided health check URL and the specified health check timeout settings to perform health checks. If health checks go well, the next step is to perform load balancing of service instances. Load balancing is attempted only if the corresponding deployable item has been defined to be loadBalanced. To perform load balancing between service instances, Singularity supports a rich integration with a specific Load Balancer API. Singularity will post requests to the Load Balancer API to add the newly deployed service instances and to remove those that were previously running. Check Integration with Load Balancers to learn more. Singularity also provides generic webhooks which allow third party integrations, which can be registered to follow request, deploy, or task updates.\n\nSlave Placement\nWhen matching a Mesos resource offer to a deploy, Singularity can use one of several strategies to determine if the host in the offer is appropriate for the task in question, or SlavePlacement in Singularity terms. Available placement strategies are:\n\nGREEDY: uses whatever slaves are available\nSEPARATE_BY_DEPLOY/SEPARATE: ensures no 2 instances / tasks of the same request and deploy id are ever placed on the same slave\nSEPARATE_BY_REQUEST: ensures no two tasks belonging to the same request (regardless if deploy id) are placed on the same host\nOPTIMISTIC: attempts to spread out tasks but may schedule some on the same slave\n\nSlave placement can also be impacted by slave attributes. There are three scenarios that Singularity supports:\n\nSpecific Slaves -> For a certain request, only run it on slaves with matching attributes - In this case, you would specify requiredSlaveAttributes in the json for your request, and the tasks for that request would only be scheduled on slaves that have all of those attributes.\n\nReserved Slaves -> Reserve a slave for specific requests, only run those requests on those slaves - In your Singularity config, specify the reserveSlavesWithAttributes field. Singularity will then only schedule tasks on slaves with those attributes if the request's required attributes also match those.\n\nTest Group of Slaves -> Reserve a slave for specific requests, but don't restrict the requests to that slave - In your Singularity config, specify the reserveSlavesWithAttributes field as in the previous example. But, in the request json, specify the allowedSlaveAttributes field. Then, the request will be allowed to run elsewhere in the cluster, but will also have the matching attributes to run on the reserved slave.\n\n\nSingularity Scheduler Dependencies\nThe Singularity scheduler uses ZooKeeper as a distributed replication log to maintain state and keep track of registered deployable items, the active deploys for these items and the running tasks that fulfill the deploys. As shown in the drawing, the same ZooKeeper quorum utilized by Mesos masters and slaves can be reused for Singularity.  \nSince ZooKeeper is not meant to handle large quantities of data, Singularity can optionally (and recommended for any real usage) utilize a MySQL database to periodically offload historical data from ZooKeeper and keep records of deployable item changes, deploy request history as well as the history of all launched tasks. \nIn production environments Singularity should be run in high-availability mode by running multiple instances of the Singularity Scheduler component. As depicted in the drawing, only one instance is always active with all the other instances waiting in stand-by mode. While only one instance is registered for receiving resource offers, all instances can process API requests. Singularity uses ZooKeeper to perform leader election and maintain a single leader. Because of the ability for all instances to change state, Singularity internally uses queues which are consumed by the Singularity leader to make calls to Mesos.\nSingularity UI\nThe Singularity UI is a single page static web application served from the Singularity Scheduler that uses the Singularity API to present information about deployed items.\nIt is a fully-featured application which provides historical as well as active task information. It allows users to view task logs and interact directly with tasks and deploy requests.\n\nOptional Slave Components\nSingularity Executor\nUsers can opt for the default Mesos executor, the Docker container executor, or the Singularity executor. Like the other executors, the Singularity executor is executed directly by the Mesos slave process for each task that executes on a slave. The requests sent to the executor contain all the required data for setting up the running environment like the command to execute, environment variables, executable artifact URLs, application configuration files, etc. The Singularity executor provides some advanced (configurable) features:\n\nCustom Fetcher Downloads and extracts artifacts over HTTP, directly from S3, or using the S3 Downloader component.\nLog Rotation Sets up logrotate for specified log files inside the task directory.\nTask Sandbox Cleanup. Can cleanup large (uninteresting) application files but leave important logs and debugging files.\nGraceful Task Killing. Can send SIGTERM and escalate to SIGKILL for graceful shutdown of tasks.\nEnvironment Setup and Runner Script. Provides for setup of environment variables and corresponding bash script to run the command.\n\nS3 Uploader\nThe S3 uploader reliably uploads rotated task log files to S3 for archiving. These logs can then be downloaded directly from the Singularity UI. \nS3 Downloader\nThe S3 downloader downloads and extract artifacts from S3 outside of the context of an executor - this is useful to avoid using the memory (page cache) of the executor process and also downloads from S3 without pre-generating expiring URIs (a bad idea inside Mesos.)\nSingularity Executor Cleanup\nWhile the Mesos slave has the ability to garbage collect tasks, the cleanup process maintains consistent state with other Singularity services (like the uploader and log watcher). This is a utility that is meant to run in each slave on CRON (e.g once per hour) and will clean the sandbox of finished or failed tasks that the Singualrity executor failed to clean.\nLog Watcher\nThe log watcher is an experimental service that provides log tailing and streaming / forwarding of executor task log lines to third party services like fluentd or logstash to support real-time log viewing and searching.\nOOM Killer\nThe Out of Memory process Killer is an experimental service that replaces the default memory limit checking supported by Mesos and Linux Kernel CGROUPS. The intention of the OOM Killer is to provide more consistent task notification when tasks are killed. It is also an attempt to workaround Linux Kernel issues with CGROUP OOMs and also prevents the CGROUP OOM killer from killing tasks due to page cache overages.\n"},"Docs/about/requests-and-deploys.html":{"url":"Docs/about/requests-and-deploys.html","title":"Requests and Deploys","keywords":"","body":"Requests and Deploys\nSingularity uses the concepts of a Request and Deploy to keep track of changes to a particular task or set of related tasks.\nA Request can be thought of as the high level information for a single project or deployable item. For example, the name and owner's email for a single web service, or the name and cron schedule for a single scheduled job.\nA Deploy can then be thought of as the specific configuration or version of the running code for that deployable item.\nTo illustrate the differences between and usages of these two concepts, we will walk through an example using Singularity to run a single web service.\nThe TestService Example\nCreating a Request\nYou have a new web service called TestService that you want to run via Singularity. The first thing you need to do is create a Request for TestService. To create this request, you would POST json over http to the Singularity API (/api/requests) or create a request via the new request page in the Singularity UI. Example json:\n{\n    \"id\": \"TestService\",\n    \"requestType\": \"SERVICE\",\n    \"owners\": [\"me@test.com\"],\n    \"instances\": 1,\n}\n\nThis Request now holds high level information about your web service. Singularity knows it is a long running SERVICE named TestService and that you want to run 1 instance of this service.\nCreating a Deploy\nNow you want TestService to actually run. To do this, you need to create a Deploy for the TestService Request. This deploy will let Singularity know all of the information necessary to actually build and launch a task. This information includes things like the command to run, environment variables to set, the location of any artifacts to download, or the resources that should be allocated to a task. You would create this deploy by POSTing json to the Singularity API's deploy endpoint (/api/deploys), or creating a new deploy in the Singularity UI. Example json:\n{\n  \"deploy\": {\n    \"requestId\":\"TestService\",\n    \"id\":\"5\",\n    \"resources\": {\n        \"cpus\":1,\n        \"memoryMb\":128,\n        \"numPorts\":2\n    }, \n    \"command\":\"java -Ddw.server.applicationConnectors[0].port=$PORT0 -Ddw.server.adminConnectors[0].port=$PORT1 -jar singularitytest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server example.yml\",\n    \"uris\": [\n        \"https://github.com/HubSpot/singularity-test-service/releases/download/1.0/singularitytest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\",\n        \"https://github.com/HubSpot/singularity-test-service/releases/download/1.0/example.yml\"\n    ],\n    \"healthcheck\": {\n       \"uri\": \"/\"\n     }\n  }\n}\n\nPosting this to Singularity creates a PendingDeploy. Singularity will then try to build and launch tasks using the information provided in the Deploy json (i.e. a task with those artifacts that needs 1 cpu, 128MB of memory, etc and is run with that command). Singularity will also know to only build and launch 1 of these tasks based on the number of instances you set in the Request earlier. Once that task is launched and Singularity determines it is healthy, the Deploy succeeds and the Deploy json you provided is now the ActiveDeploy.\nA New Deploy\nLet's say some changes were made to the TestService code and you want to run the new version in Singularity, maybe with a bit more memory as well. You would create a new Deploy json with information about the new code to run, and updated memory value and POST that to the Singularity API (/api/deploys), or create a new deploy in the Singularity UI.\nSingularity sees a new Deploy has been started and makes that the PendingDeploy for the TestService Request. Singularity will then try to build and launch 1 new task with the configuration specified in the new PendingDeploy (note that the task from the previous Deploy is still running and it's settings are unchanged). Once the task is launched and determined to be healthy, that new Deploy now becomes the ActiveDeploy and the task from the old deploy is shut down.\nUpdating the Request\nNow, for example, you notice TestService is getting more traffic than expected and you want to run 3 instances instead of just 1. You can PUT a new number of instances over http to the Singularity API (/api/requests/request/{requestId}/scale), or click Scale on the Singularity UI request page and enter a new number of instances to update our number of instances. Example json:\n{\n    \"id\": \"TestService\",\n    \"requestType\": \"SERVICE\",\n    \"owners\": [\"me@test.com\"],\n    \"instances\": 3,\n}\n\nSingularity sees this update to the request and will try to build and launch 2 additional tasks so that there are 3 total instances running. The configuration/resources/command/etc for these new tasks will be determined from the current ActiveDeploy. In other words, there is no need to re-deploy TestService to scale the number of instances up or down. This information is saved separate from the more detailed information in the deploy. If you were to create another new deploy after scaling, Singularity would then build and launch 3 new tasks for that new deploy.\n"},"Docs/about/ui.html":{"url":"Docs/about/ui.html","title":"Singularity UI","keywords":"","body":"Singularity UI\nThe Singularity UI is a single page web app that uses the Singularity API to present information about deployed items. \n\nIt allows searching and display of information about active, paused, cooled down, cleaning, and pending items.\n\nSelecting a specific deployed item will display information about its active running tasks, all historical tasks from past deploys, a list of all executed deploys and a list of all updates to item settings (owners, instances, etc.) \n\nSelecting an active task will display information about the task and provide access to application files and task logs.\n\nHistorical information about past task executions are also available and the Singularity UI allows users to directly retrieve the archived log files.\n\nClicking on a deploy id will show all tasks associated with that deploy and any failure information if the deploy has failed.\n\nA dashboard with the user's deployed and favored items is available.\n\nThe Singularity UI contains functionality for performing certain actions on registered deployable items and their tasks:\n\nRemove a deployed item. All running tasks (e.g. the service instances if it is a web service) are terminated and the item is unregistered from Singularity. Historical logs are not removed and will be connected with the item if it is re-registered to Singularity at a later stage.\nPause a deployed item. All running tasks are stopped but the item is not removed. Deploys of paused items are not possible. Users can un-pause the item to restart its tasks and be able to deploy.\nManually run a Scheduled Job or On-Demand item\nKill a running task. Tasks corresponding to instances of web service or worker items will be re-started instantly (if possible) - likely in another slave. Scheduled tasks will behave as if the task failed and may be rescheduled to run in the future depending on whether or not the job item has numRetriesOnFailure set.\nDecommission a slave which means that all tasks running in the specific slave will be migrated to other slaves.\nDecommission a logical rack, meaning that all slave hosts in the rack will be decommissioned. The rackid attribute can be used when running the Mesos slave process to specify which rack the slave belongs to. For example when running in AWS a rack could corresponds to the availability zone ( /usr/local/sbin/Mesos-slave --attributes=rackid:us-east-1e).\n\n\n\nFor all displayed information, access is provided to the API payloads from which views are created.

Set up a Zookeeper cluster\nSingularity uses Zookeeper as its primary datastore -- it cannot run without it.\nChef recipe: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/zookeeper\nPuppet module: https://forge.puppetlabs.com/deric/zookeeper\nMore info on how to manually set up a Zookeeper cluster lives here\nFor testing or local development purposes, a single-node cluster running on your local machine is fine. If using the docker testing/development setup, this will already be present.\n2. Set up MySQL (optional)\nSingularity can be configured to move stale data from Zookeeper to MySQL after a configurable amount of time, which helps reduce strain on the cluster. If you're running Singularity in Production environment, MySQL is encouraged. See the database reference for help configuring the database.\n3. Set up a Mesos cluster\nMesosphere provides a good tutorial for setting up a Mesos cluster: https://open.mesosphere.com/getting-started/install/. You can skip the section on setting up Marathon since Singularity will be our framework instead.\n4. Build or download the Singularity JAR\nIn order to run Singularity, you can either build it from scratch or download a precompiled JAR for the SingularityService module.\nBuilding from Source\nRun mvn clean package in the root of the Singularity repository. The SingularityService JAR will be created in SingularityService/target/.\nDownloading a precompiled JAR\nSingularity JARs are published to Maven Central for each release. You can view the list of SingularityService (the executable piece of Singularity) JARs here\nBe sure to only use the shaded.jar links -- the other JARs won't work.\n5. Create a Singularity Config File\nSingularity requires a YAML file with some configuration values in order to start up. Here's an example:\n\n# Run SingularityService on port 7099 and log to /var/log/singularity-access.log\nserver:\n  type: simple\n  applicationContextPath: /singularity\n  connector:\n    type: http\n    port: 7099\n  requestLog:\n    appenders:\n      - type: file\n        currentLogFilename: /var/log/singularity-access.log\n        archivedLogFilenamePattern: /var/log/singularity-access-%d.log.gz\n\n# omit this entirely if not using MySQL\ndatabase: \n  driverClass: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\n  user: [database username]\n  password: [database password]\n  url: jdbc:mysql://[database host]:[database port]/[database name]\n\nmesos:\n  master: zk://[comma separated host:port list of ZK hosts]/mesos\n  defaultCpus: 1\n  defaultMemory: 128\n  frameworkName: Singularity\n  frameworkId: Singularity\n  frameworkFailoverTimeout: 1000000\n\nzookeeper:\n  quorum: [comma separated host:port list of ZK hosts]\n  zkNamespace: singularity\n  sessionTimeoutMillis: 60000\n  connectTimeoutMillis: 5000\n  retryBaseSleepTimeMilliseconds: 1000\n  retryMaxTries: 3\n\nlogging:\n  loggers:\n    \"com.hubspot.singularity\" : TRACE\n\nenableCorsFilter: true\nsandboxDefaultsToTaskId: false  # enable if using SingularityExecutor\n\nui:\n  title: Singularity (local)\n  baseUrl: http://localhost:7099/singularity # If hosting singularity on another domain, use that domain instead of localhost\n\nFull configuration documentation lives here: configuration.md\n6. Run MySQL migrations (if necessary)\nIf you're operating Singularity with MySQL, you first need to run a liquibase migration to create all appropriate tables: (this snippet assumes your Singularity configuration YAML exists as singularity_config.yaml)\njava -jar SingularityService/target/SingularityService-*-shaded.jar db migrate singularity_config.yaml --migrations mysql/migrations.sql\nIt's a good idea to run a migration each time you upgrade to a new version of Singularity.\n7. Start Singularity\njava -jar SingularityService/target/SingularityService-*-shaded.jar server singularity_config.yaml\nWarning: Singularity will abort (i.e. exit) when it hits an unrecoverable error, so it's a good idea to use monit, supervisor, or systemd to monitor and automatically restart the Singularity process. It does this in order to simplify the handling of state which must be kept in sync with the Mesos master.\nOnce started the Singularity UI will be available at http://(host):7099/singularity\n8. Install extra Singularity tools on Mesos slaves (optional)\nSingularity ships with a custom Mesos executor and extra background jobs to make running tasks easier. You can find more info about the slave extras here.\n"},"Docs/getting-started/basic-examples.html":{"url":"Docs/getting-started/basic-examples.html","title":"Examples","keywords":"","body":"Singularity Deploy Examples\n\nCreating A Request\nBasic Service Using the Mesos Executor\nBasic Service Using Allocated Ports\nBasic Load Balanced Service with Allocated Ports\nScaling Up Services\nDocker Service with Host Networking\nDocker Service with Bridge Networking\nLoad Balanced Docker Service Using The SingularityExecutor\n\nThese examples assume you have installed Singularity.\nThe services deployed will be a build of a sample Dropwizard service. It has two enpoints /hello and /environment.\nFor this walkthrough we will assume you are using the docker-compose example cluster and that Singularity is running at http://localhost:7099/singularity. For your own case you can replace localhost with whatever host Singularity is running on in your setup. (e.g. if using boot2docker you would use the vm's ip of 192.168.59.103)\nCreating A Request\nAll deployments belong to requests. Before you can deploy you need to create a request. A request represents your service or scheduled job.\nCreate a new request on the new request page (/singularity/requests/new) in the ui, and set the following:\n\nID: singularity-test-service\nOwners: Your email address\nType: Service\n\nYou can also create the request using a JSON HTTP POST:\n{\n    \"id\": \"singularity-test-service\",\n    \"owners\": [\n        \"you@example.com\"\n    ],\n    \"requestType\": \"SERVICE\",\n    \"rackSensitive\": false,\n    \"loadBalanced\": false\n}\n\nYou can POST this JSON (saved in request.json) using curl:\ncurl -i -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d@request.json \\\nhttp://localhost:7099/singularity/api/requests\n\nBasic Service Using the Mesos Executor\nIn order to deploy using the default Mesos executor you will need to push the deployment artifacts to an accessible location. In this example they are available in a GitHub release.\nTo deploy using the web UI:\n\nDeploy ID: 1\nCommand to execute: java -jar singularitytest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server example.yml\nArtifacts:\nhttps://github.com/HubSpot/singularity-test-service/releases/download/1.0/singularitytest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\nhttps://github.com/HubSpot/singularity-test-service/releases/download/1.0/example.yml\n\n\nCPUs: 0.1 (in the default docker setup there is only one CPU resource in the slave, to test multiple deployments and scaling we'll use less CPU resources.)\n\nThe equivalent JSON which can be used instead of the web UI:\n{\n    \"deploy\": {\n        \"requestId\": \"singularity-test-service\",\n        \"id\": \"1\",\n        \"command\": \"java -jar singularitytest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server example.yml\",\n        \"resources\": {\n            \"cpus\": 0.1,\n            \"memoryMb\": 128,\n            \"numPorts\": 2\n        },\n        \"uris\": [\n            \"https://github.com/HubSpot/singularity-test-service/releases/download/1.0/singularitytest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\", \n            \"https://github.com/HubSpot/singularity-test-service/releases/download/1.0/example.yml\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nYou can POST this JSON (saved in deploy.json) using curl:\ncurl -i -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d@deploy.json \\\nhttp://localhost:7099/singularity/api/deploys\n\nWhen the task launches nothing may be visible in the Singularity UI at first, this is due to the Mesos executor fetching the artifacts first.\nOnce the task is running you can go to http://localhost:7099/singularity/requests/singularity-test-service to see the currently running tasks and status of the request.\nLimitations\n\nSince this container is bound to the ports 8080 and 8081 on the host machine you can't scale it up to more than one per machine. Depending on your setup, you may already see port in use errors when starting the app, as those ports are commonly used by other processes.\n\nBasic Service Using Dynamically Allocated Ports\nSingularity can allocate ports to the service, this allows multiple services to run on the same machine, even when they would ordinarily have port clashes.\nWhen allocating ports Singularity will set PORT0...N environment variables you can use to map your service's ports.\nThe Dropwizard example exposes a healthcheck on http://(host):8081/healthcheck. This can be used by Singularity to determine the healthiness of the service on deploys or when a new task is launched.\nThe health check by default uses the first port on the container, so we'll need to map it before the application port.\nIn this example we'll be using java -Ddw.server.applicationConnectors[0].port=$PORT1 -Ddw.server.adminConnectors[0].port=$PORT0  ... to map the ports, the Singularity health check uses the first available port so we'll assign admin to port 0 to ensure /healthcheck works.\nMake another deploy request:\n\nDeploy ID: 2\nCommand to execute: java -Ddw.server.applicationConnectors[0].port=$PORT1 -Ddw.server.adminConnectors[0].port=$PORT0 -jar singularitytest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server example.yml\nArtifacts:\nhttps://github.com/HubSpot/singularity-test-service/releases/download/1.0/singularitytest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\nhttps://github.com/HubSpot/singularity-test-service/releases/download/1.0/example.yml\n\n\nCPUs: 0.1 \nNum. ports: 2\nHealthcheck URI: /healthcheck\n\nOr post the following JSON:\n{\n    \"deploy\": {\n        \"requestId\": \"singularity-test-service\",\n        \"id\": \"2\",\n        \"command\": \"java -Ddw.server.applicationConnectors[0].port=$PORT1 -Ddw.server.adminConnectors[0].port=$PORT0 -jar singularitytest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server example.yml\",\n        \"resources\": {\n            \"cpus\": 0.1,\n            \"memoryMb\": 128,\n            \"numPorts\": 2\n        },\n        \"uris\": [\n            \"https://github.com/HubSpot/singularity-test-service/releases/download/1.0/singularitytest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\", \n            \"https://github.com/HubSpot/singularity-test-service/releases/download/1.0/example.yml\"\n        ],\n        \"healthcheck\": {\n          \"uri\": \"/healthcheck\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nYou can navigate to the running task in the UI and get the two ports. You can then access the service on those ports (for example my service got allocated 31428,31429, so I could then use curl http://localhost:31429/ to fetch the hello world JSON).\nBasic Load Balanced Service with Allocated Ports\nIf Singularity is configured with a load balancer api like Baragon, you can also have Singularity keep your load balancer up to date. When a task is started and healthy, Singularity will notify the load balacner api of the new service and the port that it is running on.\nBecause our previous request is already running, you cannot update our non-load-balanced service to be load balanced. Instead, create a new request for a load balanced version of our service. This can be done by POSTing json to the request endpoint similar to the following (note the \"loadBalanced\": true).\n{\n    \"id\": \"singularity-test-load-balanced-service\",\n    \"owners\": [\n        \"you@example.com\"\n    ],\n    \"requestType\": \"SERVICE\",\n    \"rackSensitive\": false,\n    \"loadBalanced\": true\n}\n\nYou can POST this JSON (saved in request.json) using curl:\ncurl -i -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d@request.json \\\nhttp://localhost:7099/singularity/api/requests\n\nWe will need to add some information for the load balancer api to our JSON:\n\"serviceBasePath\":\"/\",\n\"loadBalancerGroups\":[\"test\"]\nThis allows Singularity to tell the load balancer api what groups/clusters the service should be available on, and what path on that cluster belongs to this service.\nMake another deploy request by posting the following JSON:\n{\n    \"deploy\": {\n        \"requestId\": \"singularity-test-load-balanced-service\",\n        \"id\": \"3\",\n        \"command\": \"java -Ddw.server.applicationConnectors[0].port=$PORT1 -Ddw.server.adminConnectors[0].port=$PORT0 -jar singularitytest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server example.yml\",\n        \"resources\": {\n            \"cpus\": 0.1,\n            \"memoryMb\": 128,\n            \"numPorts\": 2\n        },\n        \"uris\": [\n            \"https://github.com/HubSpot/singularity-test-service/releases/download/1.0/singularitytest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\", \n            \"https://github.com/HubSpot/singularity-test-service/releases/download/1.0/example.yml\"\n        ],\n        \"skipHealthchecksOnDeploy\": false,\n        \"healthcheck\": {\n          \"uri\": \"/healthcheck\"\n        },\n        \"serviceBasePath\":\"/\",\n        \"loadBalancerGroups\":[\"test\"]\n    }\n}\n\nAfter the task becomes healthy you will also be able to see that the service was successfully registered with the load balancer api. \nScaling Up\nScaling up is easy, navigate to your request and click the \"Scale\" button. Type in a new value (e.g. 3) and wait for the new tasks to run. Since the ports are managed by Singularity you don't have to worry about them clashing.\nSide note: You'll notice that each running task returns different ids in the hello world response. This is due to each being an independent process, with separate counters.\nDocker Service with Host Networking\nAn alternative approach to running in the Mesos executor (or the Singularity executor) is to use Docker.\nThere is a Docker image built of the example service which can be used for deployments.\nSince we are using host networking the Docker container will bind to the host ports 8080 and 8081 again, so we will need to first scale down the current instances.\nTo scale down go to your request and click the \"Scale\" button again. Enter in 1 to reduce the number of running tasks. You should see two of the tasks move into \"Task Cleaning\" states.\nTo deploy this image create another deployment, but use Docker instead of default:\n\nID: 3\nExecutor Type: Docker\nDocker Image: hubspot/singularity-test-service:1.0\nCPUs: 0.1\n\nThe equivalent JSON:\n{\n    \"deploy\": {\n        \"requestId\": \"singularity-test-service\",\n        \"id\": \"3\",\n        \"containerInfo\": {\n            \"type\": \"DOCKER\",\n            \"docker\": {\n                \"network\": \"HOST\",\n                \"image\": \"hubspot/singularity-test-service:1.0\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"resources\": {\n            \"cpus\": 0.1,\n            \"memoryMb\": 128,\n            \"numPorts\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis will pull down the Docker image from the Docker registry and start the container. The ports will be bound to the Mesos slave host, so the service will be available again at http://localhost:8080/. The command to run is already set in the docker image, so in this case it is not set in the deploy. Any command set in the deploy json will override the command for the docker container (i.e CMD in Dockerfile)\nDocker Service with Bridge Networking and Dynamically Allocated Ports\nInstead of binding to the host network Docker can set up a bridge network and bind the container's ports to the external ports. The container doesn't have to know what the external ports are (or if they are bound at all), so you don't have to pass this configuration into the container.\nYou could specify port mappings in the Singularity UI or POST JSON like the following:\n{\n    \"deploy\": {\n        \"requestId\": \"singularity-test-service\",\n        \"id\": \"4\",\n        \"containerInfo\": {\n            \"type\": \"DOCKER\",\n            \"docker\": {\n                \"network\": \"BRIDGE\",\n                \"image\": \"hubspot/singularity-test-service:1.0\",\n                \"portMappings\": [\n                    {\n                        \"containerPortType\": \"LITERAL\",\n                        \"containerPort\": 8081,\n                        \"hostPortType\": \"FROM_OFFER\",\n                        \"hostPort\": 0,\n                        \"protocol\": \"tcp\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"containerPortType\": \"LITERAL\",\n                        \"containerPort\": 8080,\n                        \"hostPortType\": \"FROM_OFFER\",\n                        \"hostPort\": 1,\n                        \"protocol\": \"tcp\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        },\n        \"resources\": {\n            \"cpus\": 0.1,\n            \"memoryMb\": 128,\n            \"numPorts\": 2\n        },\n        \"healthcheck\": {\n          \"uri\": \"/healthcheck\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nPost this using curl:\ncurl -i -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d@deploy.json  http://localhost:7099/singularity/api/deploys\n\nThe FROM_OFFER specification and hostPort of 0 lets Singularity know to use the dynamically allocated port with index 0 (i.e. the first port) as the hostPort.\nYou can go back to the request and watch the task starting.\nYou can also scale it up in a similar manner, this time you should notice the new tasks starting much faster. This is because the Docker layers are already on the machine, so the Docker pull should be nearly instant.\nLoad Balanced Service Using The SingularityExecutor\nAs we saw above we can add the loadBalancerGroups and serviceBasePath fields to our deploy and have our service be load balanced.\nNow, we also want to add in the SingularityExecutor, Singularity's custom executor.

You can do the following:\n./dev pull           # Get the latest images from docker hub\n./dev start          # start mesos clsuter in background\n./dev attach         # start mesos cluster and watch output in console\n./dev restart        # stop all containers and restart in background\n./dev rebuild        # stop all containers, rebuild Singularity and docker images, then start in background\n./dev rebuild attach # rebuild and watch output when started\n./dev remove         # remove stopped containers\n./dev stop           # stop all containers\n./dev kill           # kill all containers (ungraceful term)\nThe output from the dev script will give you information about where the SingularityUI can be reached.\nBuilding new images\nSingularity uses the docker-maven-plugin for building its images. There are a few images related to Singularity:\n\nhubspot/singularityservice - The Singularity scheduler itself\nhubspot/singularityexecutorslave - A mesos slave with java/logrotate and the custom SingularityExecutor installed\nhubspot/singularitybase - A base image for singularityexecutorslave that takes care of installing java/logrotate/etc on top of the mesos slave image (not built with maven plugin)\n\nLogs and Entering Containers\nIf you are not attached to the docker-compose process, you can check the output of your containers using docker logs. Start by checking docker ps to see what containers are running. Generally they will have names like singularity_(process name). From there you can run docker logs (name) to see the stdout for that container.\nNeed to see more than stdout? You can also get a shell inside the container and poke around. Once you know the name of your container, you can run docker exec -it (name) /bin/bash to get am interactive shell inside the running container.\nIntegration Tests\nThe SingularityServiceIntegrationTests module will run tests on a cluster consisting of a singularity scheduler, zk instance, mesos master, and three mesos slaves.

Once that's done, you're ready to roll!\nDeveloping locally\nSo far you have SingularityUI with all its dependencies installed. You're able to run SingularityUI and have it served using gulp serve. What we need now is a running SingularityService to pull information from.\nIf you don't have one already (e.g. your team might be running one you can use), you can easily run your own via Docker. If running via docker, it is helpful to add the host that docker is running on to your /etc/hosts file as docker so we can reference it by hostname. If using boot2docker this is your boot2docker ip. We will reference the hostname as docker in the examples below.\nOnce the cluster is up and running, the API's root is available at http://docker/singularity/api by default.\nYou might also be running SingularityService locally without a VM. This works too!\n\nFrom this point onwards we're assuming you have a running SingularityService you can use. We'll be using http://docker/singularity/api as a placeholder for the root URL of the API you're using.\nCross-domain restrictions\nIf you're using the docker-compose setup for your API you can go ahead and skip this section.\nIf you're using a different API you should be aware that SingularityService has an enableCorsFilter option in its server config. If enabled, cross-domain restrictions won't apply. The docker service has this enabled by default which is why we're not worried about it.\nYour browser will not allow cross-domain requests if you're using a server without the CORS filter enabled. To get around this we'll use an open-source HubSpot mini-proxy called vee.\nIf you're able to configure your own nginx or Apache server to be used as a proxy, feel free to do it that way if you wish. Otherwise, read on!\nGo ahead and install vee by running npm install -g vee.\nAfterwards you will need to create a .vee file which will act as the configuration. Place this inside of /SingularityUI. Here is an example .vee file you can use:\nname: SingularityUI\n\nroutes:\n\n  # Redirect static assets to local server (assuming it is on port 3334)\n  \".*/static/.*\": \"http://localhost:3334/\"\n\n  # Redirect any API calls to the QA Singularity service (the slash after the domain is necessary)\n  \".*/api/.*\": \"http://docker/\"\n  \".*/login/.*\": \"http://docker/\"\n\n  # All else to the index.html (for all other Backbone routes)\n  \".*\": \"http://localhost:3333/singularity/\"\n\n# Uncomment to debug the above routes\n# debug: true\n\nOnce you have the file up and running, go ahead and run vee (from the dir .vee is in):\n# Run vee on ports 80 and 443\nsudo vee\n\n# Run vee on specific ports\nvee -p 4001 -s 4002\n\nAssuming you used the second command, you can now access SingularityUI by going to http://localhost:4001/singularity.\nIf you're confused as to what's going on here, all your requests are being processed by vee so that:\n\nRequests to localhost:4001/singularity/api are sent to the server at docker.\nAll other requests, including static files, are sent to the gulp server running locally.\n\nConnecting to the API\nSo far you have SingularityUI being served by gulp, and SingularityService running somewhere. If you have a proxy like vee running too, please replace the ports/URIs that follow with the ones you're using for the proxy.\nOpen up SingularityUI in your browser by going to http://localhost:3333.\nYou'll be prompted to input an API root. This is the service that SingularityUI will interact with for its data. Give it your http://docker/singularity/api URI.\nYou can change the value of this at any point by typing the following in your JS console:\nlocalStorage.setItem('apiRootOverride', 'http://docker/singularity/api')\n\nAnd there you go! You should at this point have SingularityUI running in your browser with it connected to SingularityService. Just let gulp watch and compile your files as you work and try it out in your browser.\nWhile we're on the topic of localStorage overrides, another useful one you can use disables the auto-refresh which will stop the page re-rendering so you can properly inspect the DOM:\nlocalStorage.setItem('suppressRefresh', true)\n\nCode structure\nAs mentioned before, SingularityUI uses React and Redux. If you're not familiar with how they do things, please look into them and familiarize yourself with React's lifecycle and the Redux store and dispatch.\nWhat follows is a run-down of how things work in Singularity, using the Webhooks page as an example.\nFirst you request /singularity/webhooks. This triggers our router to fire up Webhooks.\nWhen the Webhooks component is called, the initial action occurs in the connect() function call at the bottom of the page.\nFirst, connect() calls mapStateToProps(). Though it is called with the redux store and the component's own props, the Webhooks page doesn't have props passed into it. This returns props that are obtained from the redux store, such as API calls.\nThen connect() calles mapDispatchToProps(). This is called with the redux dispatch and the component's own props, and returns props are functions which can perform actions.\nconnect() combines the outputs of mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps() into one object and passes that in as props to the component the result of connect() is called with.\nThe result of connect() is called with the rootComponent. rootComponent sets up automatically refreshing the page and can display a 404 page if the component sets a notFound prop. The passed-in refresh() function fetches the page data from the API (in some cases in which initial data needs to not be fetched again, an initialize() function is also passed in to perform only initial calls). While the rootComponent is waiting for this to finish, the loading animation is displayed.\nFinally, once the API call does complete, rootComponent takes the props provided by connect() and passes them into the Webhooks component itself, which will render the table of webhooks that you see.\nEverything else is standard React-structured code. Please refer to the official docs for how to do things like respond to UI events, etc.\nTo summarize:\n\nReact Router bootstraps everything for the page.\nAll API calls necessary for rendering the page are performed in the primary component's refresh() or initialize() function.\nUse React conventions wherever possible. Try to rely on props, not component state.\n\nUseful links\nThere are some libraries/classes in SingularityUI which you should be aware of if you plan on working on it:\n\nInitialize sets up the Redux store, user settings, and the router. It also prompts the user for API root if necessary.\nRouter points requests to their respective components.\nApplication provides the naviagtion header and global search functionality.\nBase is responsible for API call behavior, including error-handling.\nUtils contains a bunch of reusable static functions.\nUITable is a comprehensive table component that provides sorting, pagination and other utilities. Data is provided by child Column components.\nFormModal provides a base for most of Singularity's modals, such as the Run Now and Pause Request modals.\n\n"},"Docs/development/load-balancer-integration.html":{"url":"Docs/development/load-balancer-integration.html","title":"Load Balancer Integration","keywords":"","body":"Load Balancers\nSingularity supports integration with a Load Balancer API (LB API) like Baragon for the purpose of coordinating deploys and normal task operations.\nRequirements\n\nProvide a loadBalancerUri in the configuration yaml\nOn request creation, set loadBalanced to true\n\nHow it works\nRequest\nSingularity POSTs a LoadBalancerRequest (LBR) with an id (LBR ID) and tasks to add and/or remove from load balancers. Singularity expects the LB API to be asynchronous and store state about operations using the provided LBR ID, which the LB API relies on Singularity to supply and should not infer context from. Singularity expects the LB API to respond to all LBR (POST, GET, or DELETE) with a LoadBalancerResponse JSON object which has the following fields:\n\nLoadBalancerState (LBS) (one of FAILED, WAITING, SUCCESS, CANCELING, CANCELED, INVALID_REQUEST_NOOP)\nLoadBalancerRequestId (echos back the LBR ID)\n\nSingularity makes a POST request to start a change of state (add or remove tasks from load balancers), but can handle any LBS response from any request. \nSingularity makes a DELETE request to request a cancel of a previously requested POST.\nEdge cases\n\nSingularity may make multiple POST or DELETE requests to the same LBR ID, especially if the LB API responds with a failure status code or does not respond quickly enough (configurable in Singularity.)\nSingularity may make a DELETE request to an LBR ID which has already succeeded, in which case the LB API should return SUCCESS, which is the state of the LBR, not the response to the DELETE request.\nSingularity may make a POST request to add a task on a different LBR ID then the LBR ID it uses to remove that task. \nSingularity assumes that CANCELED = FAILED in terms of the final result of the LBR.\nSingularity may request removal of a task that is not actually load balanced or has already been removed from load balancers. In this case, the LB API should return a status code of SUCCESS to indicate that all is well.\n\nWhen it works\nDeploys\nOnce all of the tasks in a new deploy are healthy (have entered TASK_RUNNING and have passed healthchecks, IF present), Singularity posts a LBR to add the new deploy tasks and to remove all other tasks associated with this request. The LBR ID is requestId-deployId. \nSingularity will poll (a GET on the LBR) until it receives either a SUCCESS, FAILED, or CANCELED state. While Singularity is polling, it may exceed the deadline allowed for the deploy, in which case it will make a DELETE request to the LBR, which signifies its desire to cancel the LB update. Regardless, Singularity will continue to poll until it receives one of the 3 final states and will update the deploy accordingly.\nNew Tasks\nWhen a new task starts for reasons other than a new deploy, such as to replace a failed task or due to scaling, Singularity will attempt to add that task to the LB API as part of its NewTaskChecker process. The NewTaskChecker ensures that new tasks eventually make it into TASK_RUNNING and are added to the LB API (if loadBalanced is true for that Request.) Once a new task has passed healthchecks (if necessary), Singularity will make a POST request to the LBR with the LBR ID taskId-ADD. \nSingularity will poll the GET request for this LBR until it receives a final state. If it gets a CANCELED or FAILED it will kill the new task (the scheduler should request a new one to take its place.)\nTask failures\nWhen a task fails, is lost, or killed, Singularity will add it to a queue to ensure that it is removed from the LB API if it was ever added in the first place. \nSingularity will make a POST request using the LBR ID taskId-REMOVE. It will continue to make GET and POST requests to this LBR ID until it is successfully removed (SUCCESS.)\nGraceful task cleanup (decommissions, bounces)\nSingularity will attempt to gracefully decommission tasks from the LB API when those tasks are being killed from within Singularity.\nSingularity will make a POST request using the LBR ID taskId-REMOVE. It will continue to make GET and POST requests to this LBR ID until it is successfully removed (SUCCESS.)\nSingularity will not kill the task until it is removed from the LB API.\n"},"Docs/development/basepom.html":{"url":"Docs/development/basepom.html","title":"Basepom","keywords":"","body":"Building Singularity on basepom\nBasepom is a standardized way to set up\na Maven build. Singularity leverages this to simplify its build.\nThis is a very basic primer on the features that Singularity uses from\nbasepom. It should help getting up to speed with the build system.\nProperties\nSingularity uses two sets of properties to modify basepom behavior:\ngeneral properties and dependency version properties.\nThe former influence the way the build works while the latter are used\nto control dependency versions. Basepom contains a large, curated\nsection of managed dependencies to allow for consistent and\nreproduceable dependency resolution.\nGeneral properties\nThis is a quick list of general properties set or modified in the\nSingularity build. This is a non-exhaustive list; all other available\nsettings are kept at default value.\nproject.build.targetJdk\nControls the JDK level to which the code is compiled. Singularity uses\n1.7 (JDK 7).\nproject.jdk7.home\nTo ensure a stable build independent of the JDK used, the singularity\nbuild enforces using a JDK7 class library if a newer JDK (JDK8 or\nnewer) is used. See below for [Compilation using JDK8 or newer].\nbasepom.check.skip-license\nThe license checker in the OSS version of basepom enforces the\nexistence of a license header in all source files. As Singularity does\nnot do this (yet), the checker is disabled by setting this property to\ntrue.\nbasepom.check.fail-extended\nSetting this properties to true ensures that the extended build\ncheckers:\n\nfindbugs\nPMD\ncheckstyle\nlicense\n\nwill fail the build when they find problems. This switch can be set to\nfalse using -Dbasepom.check.fail-extended=false on the command\nline to have the build succeed even if problems are present.\nDependency properties\nThe set of curated dependencies in the basepom POMs are generally\nsuitable for new projects. It may be necessary to override some\ndependency versions when converting legacy codes or when a third-party\nlibrary requires a fixed version of a dependency.\nFor Singularity, dropwizard 0.7.x enforces the following versions:\n\ndep.jackson.version, dep.jackson.core.version, dep.jackson.databind.version - Enforces 2.3.2, because dw uses Jackson 2.3.x.\ndep.jetty.version - Enforces 9.0.7.v20131107 because dw uses Jetty 9.0.x.\n\nNotes on dependencies\nThe basepom build uses the maven enforcer plugin to ensure that some\nknown bad dependencies do not get pulled into a project build. It also\nuses the maven duplicate-finder plugin to ensure that no duplicate\nresources and classes are present on the class path.\nSpecifically, the following dependencies are forbidden by the enforcer\nplugin:\n\norg.slf4j:slf4j-... - clashes with logback, leads to the dreaded 'Multiple bindings were found on the class path' error\norg.eclipse.jetty.orbit:javax.servlet - clashes with the official javax.servlet artifact, leads to duplicate classes\ncom.google.code.findbugs:jsr305 - clashes with com.google.code.findbugs:annotations, leads to duplicate classes\n\nAll dependencies that pull in one of these deps have exclusion rules\nin the main pom of the project.\nRoot and project POM dependencies\nAs a best practice, none of the actual project poms has any \ntags in their dependencies. Instead, maven will resolve these versions\nfrom the project root pom (the one in the root folder), or, in the\ncase of a well known dependency such as Google Guava, from the basepom\nPOM. No project pom should ever contain any  tag (except the\none in the  tag at the top of the project).\nDependency enforcement and artifact scope\nBasepom uses the maven dependency plugin to enforce that all required\ndependencies are listed in the project POM. This ensures that\n\nNo dependency required in code for a project is defined \"implicitly\" (by introduced as a transitive dependency)\nNo \"dangling\" dependencies are left in a project (an artifact listed in the project is not actually used by the project itself and could be removed).\n\nEach of these problems would fail the build.\nHowever, this requires that dependencies need to be correctly\nscoped. As an example, the SingularityService uses the\nio.dropwizard:dropwizard-views-mustache to render its views. This\nrenderer is discovered at runtime through the Java services lookup\nmechanism and is not referenced in code. Therefore, as the dependency\nis required at runtime but not at compile time, it needs to be\nscoped in runtime scope by adding runtime to the\ndependency.\nStandalone applications\nMany of the Singularity sub-projects actually yield standalone\nbinaries. This gets triggered by the presence of a .build-executable\nfile in the project folder.\nAny project that has this file, needs to have a property\nbasepom.shaded.main-class defined in the project POM. E.g. for the\nSingularityService there is\n\n  com.hubspot.singularity.SingularityService\n\n\ndefined in the POM for SingularityService.\nThe build for the project will now yield an additional artifact,\ncalled SingularityService-...-shaded.jar which is a standalone\nversion of the project jar, and an actually binary,\nSingularityService which can be run from the command line:\nSingularityService/target % ./SingularityService\nusage: java -jar project.jar [-h] [-v] {server,check,db} ...\n\npositional arguments:\n  {server,check,db}      available commands\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help             show this help message and exit\n  -v, --version          show the application version and exit\nCompilation using JDK8 or newer\nSingularity targets JDK7 but can be compiled with any JDK starting\nwith JDK7. Especially, the code base can be built with JDK8 (but will\ngenerate code that can be run on JDK7). However, one of the biggest\ngotchas here is that the compiler will use the Java 8 runtime library\n(bundled with the JDK8) to build code that is supposed to run on JDK7\nwith the JDK7 runtime library. As the JDK8 runtime contains a newer\nversion of the runtime, the bindings in the java code will match JDK8\nbut may or may not match JDK7.\nTherefore the Singularity build enforces that a JDK7 is installed on\nthe machine if JDK8 or newer is used to compile Singularity and its\nhome location must be set as an environment variable, JAVA7_HOME.\nCompiling with Travis CI\nAs Travis only supports a single installed JDK at a time; when the\nbuild detects that it runs in the Travis environment (by checking the\nTRAVIS environment variable), it will set the jdk7 home to be the\nsame as the current JDK. Therefore, the Travis build to JDK8 or newer\ndoes actually build against the JDK8 runtime. As Travis is only used\nas a smoke test to see whether the code base builds (and not for\ncontinous delivery), this is not a problem.\n"},"Docs/releases/":{"url":"Docs/releases/","title":"Releases","keywords":"","body":"Releases\n\nChanges in 0.14.0\nChanges in 0.13.0\nChanges in 0.12.0\nChanges in 0.11.0\nChanges in 0.10.1\nChanges in 0.10.0\nChanges in 0.9.0\nChanges in 0.8.0\nChanges in 0.7.1\nChanges in 0.7.0\nChanges in 0.6.2\nChanges in 0.6.1\nChanges in 0.6.0\nChanges in 0.5.0\nChanges in 0.4.11\nChanges in 0.4.10\nChanges in 0.4.9\nChanges in 0.4.8\nChanges in 0.4.7\nChanges in 0.4.6\nChanges in 0.4.5\n\n"},"Docs/features/custom-ports.html":{"url":"Docs/features/custom-ports.html","title":"Choosing Custom Ports","keywords":"","body":"Choosing Custom Ports\nAs of release 0.4.10, you can specify an index for the dynamically allocated port Singularity should use when healthchecking and when adding the service to the load balancer.

The section will be nested under the ui item and look like:\nui:\n  shellCommands:\n    - name: lsof\n      description: List open files, including all sockets.\n\nshellCommands is a list of objects with fields of name and `description. Now, in the ui there will be a Shell Commands section available for running tasks like the following:\n\nNext, configure the SingularityExecutor to properly run the command. Add a shellCommands section under the executor section of the config similar to the following:\nexecutor:\n  shellCommands:\n    - name: lsof\n     command: [\"/usr/sbin/lsof\", \"-P\", \"-p\", \"{PID}\"]\n\nA few important notes about the shellCommands objects:\n\nname must match the name of the command from the ui config\ncommand is an array of strings that form the shell command. Each argument should be a separate array item\n{PID} and {USER} are special items and will be replaced with the current process pid or the current user before the command is executed. Placeholder values can be changed by specifying shellCommandPidPlaceholder or shellCommandUserPlaceholder under the executor section of the config.\nIf the process you are operating on is not the parent pid (e.g. using a wrapper script), you can instead pull the process pid from a file. The file to pull from is specified by shellCommandPidFile under the executor section of the config and defaults to .task-pid (found in the root of the sandbox)\nYou can optionally prefix all commands specified with an array of command strings specified in shellCommandPrefix. This is useful for things like being sure to execute a switch user command for each command to execute.\nRunning a Shell Command\nNow that it is configured, navigate to a running task in the Singularity UI. Near the bottom there is a Shell Commands section that can be expanded. In that section, select the shell command you want from the dropdown and hit Run. An option of Redirect to command output upon success is specified by default, which will wait for the command to return and redirect you to view the output file.\n\n\nYou should see a message similar to the following indicating that the command has been sent to the executor to be run.\n\nOnce that completes, you will be redirected to the output of your command (saved as a file in the task sandbox). Back on the task detail page you will also be able to view a history of shell commands run for that process:\n\n"},"Docs/features/task-search.html":{"url":"Docs/features/task-search.html","title":"Task Search","keywords":"","body":"Task Search\nAs of 0.5.0, Singularity has better support for searching historical tasks. A global task search endpoint was added:\n/api/history/tasks -> Retrieve the history sorted by startedAt for all inactive tasks.\nThe above endpoint as well as /api/history/request/{requestId}/tasks now take additonal query parameters:\n\nrequestId: Optional request id to match (only for /api/history/tasks endpoint as it is already specified in the path for /request/{requestId}/tasks)\ndeployId: Optional deploy id to match\nhost: Optional host (slave host name) to match\nlastTaskStatus: Optional ExtendedTaskState to match\nstartedAfter: Optionally match only tasks started after this time (13 digit unix timestamp)\nstartedBefore: Optionally match only tasks started before this time (13 digit unix timestamp)\norderDirection: Sort direction (by startedAt), can be ASC or DESC, defaults to DESC (newest tasks first)\ncount: Maximum number of items to return, defaults to 100 and has a maximum value of 1000\npage: Page of items to view (e.g. page 1 is the first count items, page 2 is the next count items), defaults to 1\n\nFor clusters using mysql that have a large number of tasks in the history, a relevant  configuration option of taskHistoryQueryUsesZkFirst has been added in the base Singularity Configuration. This option can be used to either prefer efficiency or exact ordering when searching through task history, it defaults to false.\n\nWhen false the setting will prefer correct ordering. This may require multiple database calls, since Singularity needs to determine the overall order of items base on persisted (in mysql) and non-persisted (still in zookeeper) tasks. The overall search may be less efficient, but the ordering is guranteed to be correct.\n\nWhen true the setting will prefer efficiency. In this case, it will be assumed that all task histories in zookeeper (not yet persisted) come before those in mysql (persisted). This results in faster results and fewer queries, but ordering is not guaranteed to be correct between persisted and non-persisted items.\n\n\n"},"Docs/features/incremental-deploys.html":{"url":"Docs/features/incremental-deploys.html","title":"Incremental Deploys","keywords":"","body":"Incremental Deploys\nAs of 0.5.0 Singularity supports an incremental deploy for finer-grained control when rolling out new changes. This deploy is enabled via a few extra fields on the SingularityDeploy object when starting a deploy:\n\ndeployInstanceCountPerStep: Deploy this many instances at a time until the total instance count for the request is reached is reached (Optional, default is all instances at once)\ndeployStepWaitTimeMs: Wait this many milliseconds between deploy steps before continuing to deploy the next deployInstanceCountPerStep instances (Optional, default is 0, i.e. continue immediately)\nautoAdvanceDeploySteps: automatically advance to the next target instance count after deployStepWaitTimeMs seconds (Optional, defaults to true). If this is false, then manual confirmation will be needed to move to the next target instance count. This can be done via the ui.\n\nExample\nTestService is currently running 3 instances. During the next deploy, you want to replace only 1 of these instances at a time and have Singularity wait at least a minute after deploying one so you can verify that everything works as expected. The following fields can be added to the deploy json to accomplish this:\ndeployInstanceCountPerStep: 1\ndeployStepWaitTimeMs: 60000\nautoAdvanceDeploySteps: true\nWhen the deploy starts, Singularity will start 1 (deployInstanceCountPerStep) instance from the new deploy (The 3 old instances will still be running). Once the new task is determined to be healthy a few things happen:\n\nSingularity will add the instance from the new deploy to the load balancer (if applicable)\nSingularity will shut down 1 (deployInstanceCountPerStep) of the instances from the old deploy after removing it from the load balancer (if applicable)\nSingularity will start counting down the 60000 ms until it launches the next deployInstanceCountPerStep instances\n\nOnce the deployStepWaitTimeMs of wait time has elapsed, Singularity will start this process again, launching a second task for the new deploy, waiting until it is healthy, then shutting down a task from the old deploy. This will continue until the deploy fails, the deploy is cancelled, or all instances are part of the new deploy and it succeeds.\nA few more things to note about the incremental deploy process:\n\nIf the deploy fails or is cancelled, Singularity replaces any missing instances from the old deploy and makes sure they are healthy before shutting down active/healthy instances from the new deploy. (i.e. you will never be under capacity)\nAt any time, it is possible to advance the deploy to another target instance count via the UI or API. In other words, you can skip the remaining deployStepWaitTimeMs, skip steps of the deploy, or even decrease the instance count to roll back a step.\n\n"},"Docs/features/disaster-detection.html":{"url":"Docs/features/disaster-detection.html","title":"Disaster Detection & Disabled Actions","keywords":"","body":"Disaster Detection\nSingularity can be configured to automatically detect 'disaster' scenarios based on a number of indicators and can react in such a way as too limit further stress on the cluster while it is recovering.\nDisaster detection can be enabled by adding enabled: true to the disasterDetection portion of you Singularity config yaml.

The mesos containerizer can isolate the task via cpu, memory or other parameters specified using the --isolation flag when starting the mesos slave. Deploys with no containerInfo definition will try to run under this containerizer by default.\nMesos Docker Containerizer\nThe docker containerizer that ships with Mesos, will manage the starting and stopping of your docker container as well as mapping ports, adding environment variables, and mapping volumes in the container to the Mesos sandbox for that task. You can enable this containerizer by adding docker to the arguments of --containerizers when running mesos-slave.\nTo use Singularity with the Docker containerizer, add a containerInfo field with a type of DOCKER to the SingularityDeploy object when creating a deploy (without specifying a customExecutorCmd). The Singularity deploy object's containerInfo field mirrors the Mesos containerInfo definition:\n{\n  \"type\":\"DOCKER\",\n  \"docker\": {\n    \"image\": \"library/hello-world\",\n    \"privileged\": false,\n    \"network\": \"BRIDGE\", # Can be BRIDGE, HOST, or NONE.

(This is the same method of using the SingularityExecutor as for normal tasks, just adding containerInfo)\nWhen the SingularityExecutor is given a task with containerInfo of type DOCKER, it will do the following:\n\npull the Docker image\ndownload any other specified artifacts from the deploy\nmap all specified environment variables to the container\nassign and map ports and specified volumes\nmap the Mesos sandbox task directory to /mnt/mesos/sandbox in the container\ncreate and start the container, directing output to the configured logFile\nrun a docker stop when receiving a SIGTERM, try to remove the stopped container, and exit with the container's exit code\n\nA few special notes and environment variables that are set:\n\nEnvironment variables:\nMESOS_SANDBOX: The Mesos sandbox directory as seen inside the container (generally /mnt/mesos/sandbox)\nLOG_DIR: The log directory that SingularityExecutor will use for logrotating/uploading/etc, generally mapped to /mnt/mesos/sandbox/logs in the container\n\n\nThe Docker working directory will be set to the taskAppDirectory in the Mesos sandbox\nThe container name will be a configured prefix (se- by default) and the the task id (SingularityExcutorCleanup uses this to optionally clean up old contaienrs that are managed by Singularity)\nSingularityExecutor will explicitly try to pull the image (ie, must be from a repository reachable by the slave)\n\nHere is an example deploy you can use with the docker-compose setup to get you started:\n{\n  \"requestId\": \"docker-hello-world\",\n  \"id\": \"1\",\n  \"containerInfo\": {\n    \"type\": \"DOCKER\",\n    \"docker\": {\n      \"image\": \"hello-world:latest\",\n      \"privileged\": false,\n      \"network\": \"HOST\",\n      \"portMappings\": []\n    }\n  },\n  \"customExecutorCmd\": \"/usr/local/bin/singularity-executor\",\n  \"resources\": {\n    \"cpus\": 1,\n    \"memoryMb\": 1024,\n    \"numPorts\": 1\n  },\n  \"executorData\": {\n    \"cmd\": \"/hello\",\n    \"embeddedArtifacts\": [],\n    \"externalArtifacts\": [],\n    \"s3Artifacts\": [],\n    \"successfulExitCodes\": [\n      0\n    ],\n    \"user\": \"root\",\n    \"extraCmdLineArgs\": [],\n    \"loggingExtraFields\": {},\n    \"maxTaskThreads\": 2048\n  }\n}\n"},"Docs/reference/database.html":{"url":"Docs/reference/database.html","title":"Database","keywords":"","body":"Historical Data\nSingularity can optionally persist all task and deployment historical information into a MySQL database.

By default Singularity will run health checks against the first dynamically allocated port\nportNumber - An additonal override to run health checks against a specific port rather than one of the dynamically allocated ones\n\nThe first phase is the startup phase, where the task being checked is not yet responding to any health checks (as determined by a connection refused).

The http client's timeout when waiting for a response to the health check\nintervalSeconds - The period to wait between checks\nmaxRetries - The maximum number of time a check will be retried while attempting to get a successful status code in the response (i.e. maxRetries of 4 will give a maximum of 5 total checks)\nfailureStatusCodes -
